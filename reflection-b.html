      <h4>Project Challenges</h4>
      <p>The main issue was implementing the music menu and all of its features. Getting the list of music to cycle back to the beginning after reaching the end was rough to code, and adding the code that animated the menu took a while to perfect.</p>

      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
      <p>I would like to go back and make the gameplay more fun and unique than it currently is. Originally I had no ideas for a fun game, so I settled on adding what I thought was a cool feature, but what's a game with music if there's nothing to really do?</p>
